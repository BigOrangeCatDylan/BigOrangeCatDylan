Hi! I'm BigOrangeCat, I am a student at Shandong University, currently studying bioinformatics and quantitative biology. 
I entered university in 2023. My current research focus (as of 2024) is gene family analysis.
I'm in the process of updating some of the code I frequently useï¼Œ which is primarily in Python. 
It's not very professional, and some content is AI-generated, but I hope it can be helpful to those who need it.ðŸ™‚
