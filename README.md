Hi! I'm Dylan Song (Chen Song), My current research interests focus on integrating single-cell analysis, multi-omics, and biomaterial applications, particularly in developing innovative hydrogels for medical purposes and screening postbiotics to study gut microbiota interactions. I aim to combine computational tools like machine learning with experimental techniques to address challenges in bioinformatics and advance precision medicine.
